# CPQ DevKit for Salesforce - Project Template

CPQ DevKit for Salesforce - Project Template can be used to work more efficiently with the Salesforce CPQ's [Javascript Quote Calculator Plugin](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.cpq_plugins.meta/cpq_plugins/cpq_dev_jsqcp_parent.htm).

This repository is based on the proposed format by by [Austin Turner](https://github.com/paustint/) to the [SFDC QCP Extension](https://github.com/paustint/sfdc-qcp-vscode-extension) for Visual Studio Code.

## Setup

In order to use this template efficiently we recommend:
- have Nodejs installed
- have a Salesforce Developer or Sandbox org
- have the Salesforce CPQ managed package installed
- have the CPQ managed package level settings with a script enabled

## Writing Code

All the code would be located in the `src` folder. There are currently 5 examples available.

## Writing Unit Tests

When the project is initialized, a `/tests` folder will be created with a `qcp.spec.ts` file that can eb used for unit tests. The file includes some example unit tests that are commented our, which you will need to uncomment and write the unit tests.
Use `npm run test` to run your tests.
